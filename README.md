### Requirements:
* PyTorch â‰¥ 1.4
* pip install tensorboard_logger
* download and extract <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">cifar-10 dataset</a> into ./data/ 

To perform semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10 with 4 labels per class, run:
<pre>python Train_CoMatch.py --n-labeled 40 --seed 1 </pre> 

The results using different random seeds are:

seed| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | avg 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
accuracy|93.71|94.10|92.93|90.73|93.97|93.09
